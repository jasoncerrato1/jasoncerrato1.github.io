<p> Welcome to my About Me page!
    <p>  My name is Jason Cerrato, I am currently at URI majoring in computer science. <br>
    I work at an Italian restaurant called Avvio and it is located in Garden City Cranston. <br>
        My goals for this year is to further improve my computer science and fashion design skills as well as exercise more.<br>
  My interest in computer science came from my friends when they explained to me the benefits of obtaining a college degree in computer science.<br>  
       However, my passion for fashion design and other aspects of art have been a part of me my whole life <br
In my free time I like to go out with friends, watch movies, and create ideas for future projects I have in mind.<br>
Hopefully, I can improve my computer science skills and take it far, not only in college but in my future.<br>
